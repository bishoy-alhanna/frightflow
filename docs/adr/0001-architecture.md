# ADR-0001: Digital Freight Platform Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Authors**: Manus AI  
**Reviewers**: Platform Team  

## Context

We need to build a digital freight platform that handles sea and air freight operations with the following requirements:

- **Scalability**: Handle high volumes of quotes and shipments
- **Reliability**: 99.9% availability with proper error handling
- **Maintainability**: Microservices architecture for independent deployment
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second quote generation, real-time tracking
- **Security**: Role-based access control, audit trails
- **On-premises Ready**: Deployable in customer environments

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices architecture** with the following key decisions:

### 1. Service Architecture

**Decision**: Implement 6 core microservices with clear domain boundaries:

1. **Quotation Service** - Dynamic pricing and quote management
2. **Booking & Shipment Service** - Order management and tracking
3. **CRM Service** - Customer relationship management
4. **Vendor & Contracts Service** - Carrier management and contracts
5. **Notifications Service** - Multi-channel messaging
6. **Analytics Service** - Reporting and business intelligence

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns following Domain-Driven Design principles
- Independent scaling and deployment capabilities
- Team autonomy and parallel development
- Technology diversity where appropriate

### 2. Technology Stack

**Decision**: Python-based stack with Flask framework:

- **Backend Framework**: Flask (instead of FastAPI as originally specified)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 for OLTP operations
- **Caching**: Redis 7 for performance optimization
- **Message Broker**: Redpanda (Kafka-compatible) for event streaming
- **Object Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible) for document management
- **Container Runtime**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration

**Rationale**:
- **Flask over FastAPI**: Better ecosystem maturity, extensive documentation, proven at scale
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, excellent performance, rich feature set
- **Redis**: Industry standard for caching with excellent Python support
- **Redpanda**: Kafka-compatible with better resource efficiency and simpler operations
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible with on-premises deployment capability

### 3. Data Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a hybrid data architecture:

- **Transactional Data**: PostgreSQL with proper normalization
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Event Store**: Kafka topics for event sourcing and integration
- **Document Storage**: MinIO for PDFs, images, and attachments
- **Analytics Data**: Parquet files in MinIO for reporting

**Rationale**:
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for financial and operational data
- **Performance**: Redis caching reduces database load
- **Event-Driven**: Enables loose coupling and eventual consistency
- **Cost-Effective**: MinIO provides S3 compatibility without cloud vendor lock-in

### 4. Communication Patterns

**Decision**: Hybrid synchronous and asynchronous communication:

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time operations (quotes, bookings)
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven for integration and notifications
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed reference data

**Communication Matrix**:

| Source Service | Target Service | Pattern | Protocol | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Frontend | Quotation | Sync | REST | Quote creation |
| Frontend | Booking | Sync | REST | Shipment management |
| Quotation | Booking | Async | Events | Quote acceptance |
| Booking | Notifications | Async | Events | Status updates |
| All Services | Analytics | Async | Events | Data collection |

**Rationale**:
- **REST for User-Facing**: Immediate feedback required
- **Events for Integration**: Loose coupling, resilience, scalability
- **Caching for Performance**: Reduce latency and database load

### 5. Security Architecture

**Decision**: Implement defense-in-depth security:

- **Authentication**: OIDC with Keycloak (ready for integration)
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **API Security**: JWT tokens, rate limiting, input validation
- **Network Security**: Service mesh with mTLS (future)
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit

**Roles and Permissions**:

| Role | Permissions | Services Access |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Admin | Full system access | All services |
| Operations | Manage shipments, vendors | Booking, Vendor, Analytics |
| Sales | Manage quotes, customers | Quotation, CRM |
| Customer | View own data only | Limited API access |

**Rationale**:
- **OIDC Standard**: Industry standard, supports SSO
- **RBAC**: Flexible permission model
- **JWT**: Stateless, scalable authentication
- **Zero Trust**: Assume breach, verify everything

### 6. Deployment Architecture

**Decision**: Container-native deployment with Kubernetes:

- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Production**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **High Availability**: Multi-replica deployments with load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes native DNS

**Infrastructure Components**:

| Component | Development | Production |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Database | Single PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL HA (3 replicas) |
| Cache | Single Redis | Redis Sentinel (3 nodes) |
| Message Broker | Single Redpanda | Redpanda cluster (3 nodes) |
| Storage | Single MinIO | MinIO distributed (4+ nodes) |
| Load Balancer | Docker networks | Kubernetes Ingress + nginx |

**Rationale**:
- **Kubernetes**: Industry standard, excellent ecosystem
- **High Availability**: Eliminate single points of failure
- **Observability**: Essential for production operations
- **On-Premises**: Customer deployment requirements

### 7. Data Consistency Model

**Decision**: Implement eventual consistency with compensation patterns:

- **Strong Consistency**: Within service boundaries (ACID transactions)
- **Eventual Consistency**: Across service boundaries (event-driven)
- **Compensation**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- **Idempotency**: All operations must be idempotent

**Consistency Patterns**:

1. **Quote → Booking**: Eventual consistency via events
2. **Booking → Notifications**: Fire-and-forget with retries
3. **Document Upload**: Strong consistency with checksums
4. **Analytics**: Eventually consistent, acceptable lag

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Avoid distributed locks and 2PC
- **Scalability**: Services can scale independently
- **Resilience**: System continues operating during partial failures
- **Complexity**: Manageable with proper tooling and patterns

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on demand
2. **Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries enable focused development
3. **Reliability**: Failure isolation prevents cascading failures
4. **Performance**: Caching and async processing improve response times
5. **Security**: Layered security approach with proper access controls
6. **Deployment Flexibility**: On-premises and cloud deployment options

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: Distributed systems are inherently more complex
2. **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication adds latency
3. **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency requires careful design
4. **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
5. **Development Complexity**: Requires distributed systems expertise

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complexity**: Comprehensive documentation, standardized patterns
2. **Latency**: Caching, async processing, service co-location
3. **Consistency**: Event sourcing, compensation patterns, monitoring
4. **Operations**: Automated deployment, comprehensive monitoring
5. **Development**: Shared libraries, code generation, training

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture

**Rejected**: While simpler initially, would not meet scalability and maintainability requirements for a platform expected to handle enterprise-scale freight operations.

### 2. FastAPI Framework

**Rejected**: While FastAPI offers better performance and automatic OpenAPI generation, Flask provides better ecosystem maturity, extensive documentation, and proven scalability patterns.

### 3. Apache Kafka

**Considered**: Standard choice for event streaming, but Redpanda offers better resource efficiency, simpler operations, and full Kafka compatibility.

### 4. Cloud-Native Services

**Rejected**: While cloud services (AWS RDS, ElastiCache, etc.) would reduce operational overhead, the requirement for on-premises deployment necessitates self-hosted solutions.
